# 🌍 viettrace

**VietTrace** is an open-source ecosystem designed to preserve and connect the local values of Vietnam—from place names, culture, to communities—in the context of administrative, social, and environmental changes.

> 📌 *Preserving the past – Connecting the future*

## 🎯 Objectives

- Store administrative maps of Vietnam **before and after provincial mergers**
- Compare historical place names to help future generations understand **regional identity**
- Build a foundation to expand into community projects such as:
- **Local tourism & photography maps**
  - **Regional environmental protection network (Green Earth)**
  - **Volunteer network supporting disadvantaged communities (Warm Home)**
